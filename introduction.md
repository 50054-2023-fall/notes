# 50.054 - Introduction

## Module Description
This course aims to introduce a new programming paradigm to the learners, Functional programming and the suite of advanced language features and design patterns for software design and development. By building on top of these techniques, the course curates the process of designing a modern compiler, through syntax analysis, intermediate presentation construction, semantic analysis and code generation. More specifically the course focuses on the application of program analysis in areas of software verification, program optimization and software security analysis. 


## Module Learning Objective
By the end of this module, you should be able to

* Comprehend and reason functional programming
